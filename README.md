# J-Riddler
J-Riddler is a random data generator for postgres

## Motivation

Despite of database migration tools sometimes you need to have an actual data inside database tables

**J-Riddler** gives you a plain and simple CLI to fill these tables instead of writing huge **INSERT** queries by your own
